# English-to-German Language Quiz App

## Description

The **English-to-German Language Quiz App** is a mobile application designed to help English speakers learn the German language in a fun and interactive way. The app presents users with a series of questions in English, challenging them to select the correct German translation from a list of options. Users can test their knowledge, practice vocabulary, and track their progress as they advance through the quiz.

## Tech Stack

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **React Native Expo**: A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications with React Native. Expo simplifies the development process and provides tools for easy testing and deployment.

- **Firebase**: A comprehensive platform for mobile and web application development that provides real-time database storage, authentication, and hosting. Firebase is used to store quiz questions and user data.

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript used for writing more reliable and maintainable code.

- **npm**: The package manager for JavaScript used to manage project dependencies.

## Future Features and Updates

As the app continues to grow and evolve, there are some exciting features and updates in consideration:

1. **Enhanced Question Database**: In the future, we plan to expand the question database by adding separate documents for each question. Within each question document, there will be separate documents for each language pair, allowing for more flexibility in quiz content.

2. **User Progress Tracking**: Implementing user profiles and progress tracking is being explored. Users may be able to create accounts, save their quiz results, and track their language learning journey over time.

3. **Customizable Quizzes**: The ability for users to create their own custom quizzes is being considered. This feature would allow users to select specific topics or categories for their quizzes, tailoring their learning experience to their needs.

4. **Multi-Language Support**: While currently focused on English-to-German, the app may expand its language offerings, allowing users to learn and practice multiple languages.

5. **Community and Social Features**: A community aspect is envisioned, where users can connect with others, share language learning tips, and even engage in language exchange opportunities.

6. **Point System**: We are also considering implementing a point system. Users can earn points for each correct answer, and these points can be used to unlock special challenges or rewards, making the learning experience even more engaging.
